            <p>Your privacy is important to us. We designed our Privacy Policy to make important disclosures about how we collect and use your information. We encourage you to read our Privacy Policy carefully, and use it to help make informed decisions. Pursuant to the Privacy Policy, we will not disclose your photos or identifying information without your permission to prospective matches, nor theirs to you.</p>

            <h2>1. Right to Cancel Matchmaking Services</h2>
            <p>For subscribers residing in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin: You, the buyer, may cancel this contract (the "Terms of Use" or "Agreement") and receive a full refund, without any penalty or obligation, at any time prior to midnight of the third business day following the date you first submit payment for the applicable service package, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.</p>
            <p>For residents of California, Colorado, Illinois, North Carolina, and Ohio: In the event that you die before the end of your Services, your estate shall be entitled to a refund of that portion of any payment you had made for your Services which is allocable to the period after your death. In the event that you become disabled (such that you are unable to use our Services) before the end of your Services, you shall be entitled to a refund of that portion of any payment you had made for your Services which is allocable to the period after your disability by providing Family First notice in the same manner as you request a refund as described below.</p>
            <p>For residents of Iowa, New York, and Ohio who wish to cancel these Terms of Use must sign the applicable Notice of Buyer's Cancellation set forth in the form attached as Exhibits A (Iowa), B (New York), or C (Ohio). For residents of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Minnesota, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin, notice of cancellation need not take a particular form and is effective if it indicates your desire to not be bound by these Terms of Use.</p>
            <p>To cancel these Terms of Use, send an e-mail that states that you, the buyer, are canceling these Terms of Use, or words of similar effect, to customersuccess@FamilyFirst.com. Alternatively, you may mail or deliver a signed and dated notice to: Family First, Inc., 3 Germay Dr., Unit 4 #2488, Wilmington, DE 19804. Exhibit D sets forth additional specific-state laws regarding buyers' rights and requirements for notices of cancellation. As used herein, the "date of this contract" means the date you accepted these Terms of Use and were bound thereby. Matchmaking Services will not be offered for purchase through the Family First Mobile App and all cancellations and refunds related to Matchmaking Services will be handled directly by Family First. Refunds for “In-App” purchases are handled by Apple, not Family First. You can request a refund for those purchases from Apple through your Apple ID account on your phone or at https://getsupport.apple.com. All other requests for a refund may be made by contacting Customer Success at customersuccess@FamilyFirst.com or by mail as set forth in our Cancellation and Refund Policy.</p>

IF WE DECIDE TO CONDUCT ANY SCREENING THROUGH A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY, YOU HEREBY AUTHORIZE US TO OBTAIN AND USE A CONSUMER REPORT ABOUT YOU TO DETERMINE YOUR ELIGIBILITY UNDER THESE TERMS. FAMILY FIRST RESERVES THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT AND YOUR ACCOUNT, WITHOUT REFUND, IN THE EVENT THAT ANY SCREENING WE CONDUCT ON YOU SHOWS THAT YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE SERVICES OR ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE TERMS. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IN THE EVENT FAMILY FIRST CONDUCTS A CRIMINAL RECORDS SCREENING ON YOU FAMILY FIRST WILL HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A COPY OF SUCH SCREENING OR ANY OTHER SCREENING MATERIALS OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION RELATED THERETO AND FAMILY FIRST RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MAKE CHANGES TO YOUR ACCOUNT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO REVOKING ACCESS TO THE SERVICE OR TERMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT BASED ON THE RESULTS OF SUCH CRIMINAL RECORDS SCREENING.

            <h3>Reservation of Rights.</h3>

Family First and its licensors and service providers reserve and shall retain their entire right, title, and interest in and to the App, including all copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights therein or relating thereto, except as expressly granted to you in these Terms of Use.</p>
            <h3>Third Party App Store, Apple & Android Devices.</h3>
            <p>The following terms apply when you download and use the App from a third party app distributor (referred to as an “App Distributor”) through an app store such as the Apple Store or Google Play ("Third Party App Store" or "App Store").

In exercising your license to use the App you acknowledge and agree as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>(1) Family First, not the App Distributor, is responsible for providing any maintenance and support services with respect to the App as specified in the terms and conditions of this App License contained in these Terms of Use or as otherwise required under applicable law, and you acknowledge that each App Distributor has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App.</li>
              <li>(2) Family First, not the App Distributor, is solely responsible for any product warranties, subject to the terms of this Terms of Use (including but not limited to Section 16 - Disclaimers/Limitation of Liability).

              <li>(3) Family First, not the App Distributor, is responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party may have relating to the App or your possession and/or use of the App, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation; and/or (iv) intellectual property infringement claims.</li>
              <li>(4) The Content and Services are based in the United States and provided for access and use only by persons located in the United States. You acknowledge that you may not be able to access all or some of the Content and Services outside of the United States and that access thereto may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If you access the Content and Services from outside the United States, you are responsible for compliance with local laws. You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. government as a “terrorist supporting” country and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties.</li>
              <li>(5) You must comply with all applicable third-party contracts when using the mobile App, e.g., if you have a VoIP App, then you must not be in violation of such App Distributor's wireless data service agreement when using the App.</li>
              <li>(6) The App Distributors are third-party beneficiaries of the terms and conditions in this App License contained in these Terms of Use, and that each App Distributor will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the terms and conditions in this App License contained in these Terms of Use.</li>
              <li>(7) You will use the most recent version of the App.</li>
              <li>(8) By accessing or downloading the App from the Apple App Store, you are agreeing to Apple’s Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Apple Terms”) and other terms and conditions provided by Apple.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Termination of Mobile App Use License.</h3>
            <p>Without limiting the generality of Family First's rights set forth in Section 4, Family First may, in its sole and absolute discretion, at any time and for any reason, suspend or terminate this App License and the rights afforded to you hereunder with or without prior notice, and without liability to you. Furthermore, if you fail to comply with any terms and conditions of this App License, then this App License and any rights afforded to you hereunder shall terminate automatically, without any notice or other action by Family First.
